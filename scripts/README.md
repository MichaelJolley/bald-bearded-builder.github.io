# Stream scripts

## Why use scripts?

There are a few reasons I want to retain scripts and utilize them on each stream:

### Easy on-boarding

I don't ever want to take for granted that our viewers, new or existing, know or remember everything we've done in the past; what our format is; how to connect with us outside of the stream; or what interactions are available during the stream.

Having scripts removes the barrier of me having to remember everything viewers might want to know to have the best experience before, during & after a stream.

### Consistent messaging

There have been many studies that report that people don't retain information until they've been "touched" by it at least 7 times.  So scripts allows us to present information that will be helpful to the viewer in a consistent manner to aid them in retaining that information off stream.

### What was I talking about? Oh yeah, scripts.

One of, if not the biggest, benefit of using scripts on stream is that I am terrible about remembering everything I want our viewers to know.  It is very easy to be distracted by communication in chat, cheers, new followers, subscribers, etc. and forget to relay information that could greatly improve the quality of your viewers experience.
