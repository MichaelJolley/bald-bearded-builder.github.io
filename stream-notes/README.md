# Stream Notes

The `stream-notes.md` file is a template used for the notes that accompany each stream.  It's sole purpose is for me to copy/paste into a new `/docs/_streams/` location as each stream occurs to keep up with what happened during that stream and act as a "page" on the [http://baldbeardedbuilder.com](http://baldbeardedbuilder.com) website.
